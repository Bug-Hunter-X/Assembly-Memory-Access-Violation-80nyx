mov eax, [ebx + ecx*4 + 8]

This line of assembly code attempts to access memory at the address calculated by `[ebx + ecx*4 + 8]`.  The bug arises when the value of `ecx` is unexpectedly large, resulting in an address outside the allocated memory space. This can lead to a segmentation fault or other unpredictable behavior.
